Q1: What does it mean to multiply each level in a different value? What do we try to control on?

A1: By multiply each level in a different value we are giving each frequency a value that the higher
    it is the higher the frequency will be. so that the first frequency at the pyramid is the
    highest frequency and the list is sorted at descending order.
    the higher frequencies are for cases that we want to focus at the small details and the lower
    frequencies are for cases we want the noticeable details and less from the little details.
