Q2: What happens (and why this happens) to the result blending from section 4 image when:
    Blending is performed with different image filters (filter_size_im = 1,3,5,7...).

A2: changing the size of the filter will determine rather we want to preform a high filter at each
    level of the pyramid or low one. The higher the filter size is the higher the frequencies are
    and therefore we will receive an image that includes the less noticeable details.
