Q3: What happens (and why this happens) to the result blending from section 4 image when:
    Blending is performed with a varying number of pyramid levels (max_levels = 1,2,3,4,5,...)

A3: The higher the number of pyramid levels is the higher the number of frequencies is.
    and therefor we will receive a better blended image because the higher the number of frequencies
     is the more the blended image will be continuous and better.
