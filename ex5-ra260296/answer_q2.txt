Q2: Suggest how to use the workflow you have implemented in this assignment to train a network that
    could be used for super-resolution. A full answer consists of a description of the corruption
    function, and how to properly use the restore_image() function for this task. For this context only,
    you could optionally add additional operations before calling to restore_image().


A2: First I'll describe the implementation of the new corruption function. This function should decrease the resolution.
    In order to do so, I'll reduce the image, activate the corruption function on the reduced image and than re-expand it
    into its original size. Now, I'll use the restore_image() (I won't change it).
