Q1: Describe the effect of increasing the residual blocks on its performance for each task, both
    quantitatively in terms of the plot you got and qualitatively in terms of the differences in the
    image outputs of each model

A1: We can see that as the bigger the number of residual blocks is the smaller the size of error is. Furthermore, by
    increasing the number of residual blocks I noticed that the restored image looks more alike the original image.
