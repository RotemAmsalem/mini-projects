============================================================
PART A:

1.The print_to_n's function print the numbers from 1 to n.
2.The print_reversed's function print the numbers from n to 1.
3.The has_divisor_smaller_than's function function checks if the number n.
 has smaller divisor than i.
4.The is_prime's function checks if n is a prime number.
5.The divisors_list's function return all the divisors of n from i till n.
6.The divisors's function returns all the divisors of n from 1 till n.
7.The factorial's function return the factorial of n.
8.The exp_n_x's function returns the exponential sum, using the
previous functions.


PART B:

9.The play_hanoi's function implement the hanoi game. It moves all the discs
from the source rod to the destination rod using the temporary rod.
10.The print_binary_sequences_with_prefix's function prints all the possible
combinations of 1 and 0 at n length that begins with prefix.
11.The print_binary_sequences's function prints all the possible combinations
of 1 and 0 at n length.
12.The print_sequences_with_prefix's this function prints all the possible
combinations of characters from the char_list at n length that begins with
prefix.
13.The print_sequences's function prints all the possible combinations of
characters from the char_list at n length.
14.The print_no_repetition_sequences_with_prefix's function prints all the
possible combinations of characters from the char_list at n length that begins
with prefix without repeating a char more than one time.
15.The print_no_repetition_sequences's function prints all the possible.
combinations of characters from the char_list at n length without repeating a
char more than one time.
16.The no_repetition_sequences_list_with_prefix's function returns a list of
all the possible combinations of characters from the char_list at n length that
begins with prefix without repeating a char more than one time.
17.The no_repetition_sequences_list's function returns a list of all the
possible combinations of characters from the char_list at n length without
repeating a char more than one time.
